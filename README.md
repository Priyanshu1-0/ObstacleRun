A small 3D platformer game made in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. The platforms move using C++ Tick logic, vector math, and transform updates. The entire movement, timing, and behavior of actors is coded in C++, and the level is built using basic UE5 assets. Just a simple fun project to learn gameplay programming.
